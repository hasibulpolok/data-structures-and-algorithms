## 1. Introduction to Algorithms
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps to solve a problem.

Example:
Find the maximum of two numbers.

---

## 2. Algorithm Analysis
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Big-O, Omega, Theta

Example:
Linear Search -> O(n)
Binary Search -> O(log n)

---

## 3. Linear Data Structures
### Array
Fixed-size, contiguous memory.

### Stack (LIFO)
Push, Pop, Peek.

### Queue (FIFO)
Enqueue, Dequeue.

---

## 4. Tree Data Structure
A tree is a hierarchical data structure with no cycles.

Example:
        A
      /   \
     B     C
    / \
   D   E

Traversals:
- Preorder
- Inorder
- Postorder
- Level Order

---

## 5. Graph Data Structure
Graph G = (V, E)

Types:
- Directed / Undirected
- Weighted / Unweighted

Representation:
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

---

## 6. Graph Traversal

### BFS
Level-wise traversal using Queue.
Time: O(V+E)

### DFS
Depth-wise traversal using Recursion.
Time: O(V+E)

---

## 7. Spanning Tree & MST
- Spanning Tree: V-1 edges
- MST: Minimum total weight

Algorithms:
- Prim's
- Kruskal's

---

## 8. Shortest Path Algorithms
### Dijkstra
Single source shortest path.
No negative weights.

### Bellman-Ford
Handles negative weights.

### Floyd-Warshall
All-pairs shortest path.

---

## 9. Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

---

## 10. Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

---

## 11. Greedy Algorithms
- Activity Selection
- Fractional Knapsack
- Huffman Coding

---

## 12. Dynamic Programming
- Fibonacci
- Knapsack
- LCS

---

## 13. Backtracking
- N-Queen
- Sudoku Solver

---

## 14. Hashing
- Hash Function
- Collision Handling

---

## 15. Exam & Interview Notes
- BFS vs DFS
- Tree vs Graph
- Prim vs Kruskal
